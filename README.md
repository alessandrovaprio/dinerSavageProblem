# dinerSavageProblem
school project to learn threads and semaphore in C.

In order to compile it correctly you have to use the option "-lpthread".

example gcc -o selveaggi savage.c -lpthread

You can run it ./selveaggi 10 10 5  

As you can see, it needs 3 arguments:
- number of savages
- number of portion available in the pot
- number of times the savage have to eat
